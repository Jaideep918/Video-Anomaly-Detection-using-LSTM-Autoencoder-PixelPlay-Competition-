# Video-Anomaly-Detection-using-LSTM-Autoencoder-PixelPlay-Competition-
This repository contains the complete implementation of a sequence-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) system built for the PixelPlay Kaggle competition. The approach is based on an LSTM Autoencoder trained only on normal video sequences, where anomalies are detected using reconstruction error.
